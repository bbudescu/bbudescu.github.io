# 1. Definition
I am a machine learning and computer vision engineer. I help companies big and small explore the way in which computers can understand things and help people.

# 2. The Story So Far
Banal consecution of events:

student -> intern -> employee -> freelancer -> manager

Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbudescu/) for specifics.

# 3. Brief Overview
The grandest technical endeavour I've started and succesfully finished was writing a C++ library from scratch that could be used for training and applying neural nets.

I'm also pretty proud of a 3d neural net I've trained to enhance image quality in videos.

# 4. Skills

For details on the skills I've earned during my career, check out the [tech spec page](/tech_specs/). Be advised: it's long and rather boring.
