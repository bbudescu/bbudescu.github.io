This page provides a brief outline of my professional life. It looks a bit narcissistic, but it's not. At some point I realized it started to sound like an interview with myself that no one asked for, but, actually, people have asked for it, and I just obliged.

I am a machine learning and computer vision engineer. I help companies big and small explore the way in which computers can understand things and help people.
